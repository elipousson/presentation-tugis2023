    "text": "1.1 What are we talking about?\n\nA Short Introduction to R\nUsing R at the Department of Planning\nWhy use R as your GIS?\n\nFind the presentation at elipousson.github.io/presentation-tugis2023/ or the code at github.com/elipousson/presentation-tugis2023\n\nGood afternoon.\nMy name is Eli Pousson. I am a planner with the Baltimore City Department of Planning—one of two planners supporting the city’s INSPIRE program. I also teach a course for the University of Maryland Baltimore County’s GIS certificate program and I am an enthusiastic R developer and an advocate for open-source tools and open data.\nMaybe I’d even say that I’m a really enthusiastic R developer. I was first introduced to the programming language about 4 years ago and I’ve developed around two dozen packages over the past three years. This is the work I’ll be talking about today.\nI use R as my GIS—my main tool for reading, writing, analyzing, and visualizing both spatial data and truly data of all kinds.\nOK. A quick show of hands: how many people have heard of the R programming language before today? Great. Now, how many of you have used R for working with spatial data?\nOur first part may be a bit of review for anyone with more experience but, if you want to go far, go together, so I’m going to start with a short introduction to R and working with spatial data in R.\nI’ll then share a few examples of the custom packages and workflows that I’m using to support my own work as a planner at the Department of Planning.\nI’ll then wrap up with making the case for why I think you may also want to try using R as your GIS highlight a few other exciting projects that are using this tool."

Most of the time packages are designed to solve a specific problem, so they to pull together functions related to a particular data science problem (e.g., data wrangling, visualisation, inference).\n\nFrom BasicBasics 2 (R-Ladies Sydney)"
