    "text": "2.1 What is R?\n\n\nR is a programming language best known for use as a statistical programming language often used in data science and research.\nLike Python or C++, R is an object-oriented, functional programming language where the base set of features can be extended through open-source packages.\n\n\n\n\nCourtesy Wikipedia\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA package is a bundle of code that a generous person has written, tested, and then given away. Most of the time packages are designed to solve a specific problem, so they to pull together functions related to a particular data science problem (e.g., data wrangling, visualisation, inference).\n\nFrom BasicBasics 2 (R-Ladies Sydney)"

If we had more time today, I’d walk you through the code in detail and demonstrate the transformations and\nThese examples also don’t highlight the spatial features of R to their fullest extent. Buffers, spatial filters, and spatial joins cover a large share of how I work with spatal data. More often, my challenges center on the underlying attribute data: how can it be clearly standardized, visualized, and presented in an organized and accessible format."
